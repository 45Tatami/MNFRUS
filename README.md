Meguca NameFag Removal UserScript

This is a WIP and might not work as expected.

## Features

 * Filtering/Deleting by
   * Name
   * Trip
   * Text
 * Recursive filtering
 * Repairing "broken" post links (Still kinda buggy)

## How to install

Install a userscript manager like Greasemonkey and open the user.js as a raw file to install it. Settings are explained in the script itself.

Tested with Greasemonkey 3.11 on Firefox 51.0.1 (64-bit) and Meguca v4.0
